# Project Name

## Overview

This project contains a set of Python scripts designed to perform various tasks such as API handling, complexity analysis, and utility functions. The primary objective of the project is to provide tools for processing and analyzing data, with efficient algorithms implemented for specific use cases.

## Features

- **API Handling**: Efficient API request handling using `requests`.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Functions to calculate factorial and check if a number is prime, with an analysis of their time and space complexity.
- **Utility Functions**: A set of helper functions designed to streamline tasks.
- **Command-line Interface**: User-friendly command-line argument parsing using `argparse`.

## File Structure

- **main.py**: The main entry point of the project.
- **api_handler.py**: Contains functionality for making API requests and handling responses.
- **complexity_analyzer.py**: Implements mathematical algorithms such as factorial calculation and primality testing, with corresponding complexity analyses.
- **utils.py**: Includes utility functions used throughout the project.
- **test_code.py**: Unit tests for various functions in the project.
- **LICENSE**: License information for the project.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies needed to run the project.
